# SpaceX Capstone Project

This repository contains the final deliverables for the SpaceX Capstone Project, including source code, a final report, and a presentation. The project uses advanced data science and machine learning techniques to predict the landing success of SpaceX Falcon 9's first stage. The analysis integrates multi-source data collection, extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling to provide actionable insights for optimizing launch operations.
